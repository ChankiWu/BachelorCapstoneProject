# BachelorCapstoneProject

### This is Bachelor's Capstone Project for undergrad's last dance.

Following is how this web app works:

- Using the Web Speech APIâ€™s SpeechRecognition interface to listen your voice from a microphone device in your mobile phones or PC.

- Send your message to API.ai (the natural language processing platform) as a text string

- Once the AI from the API.ai returns the reply text back, use the SpeechSynthesis interface to return a synthetic voice.
