# Gradproject

This is Graduation project for University's last dance.

Following is how this web app works:

1.Using the Web Speech API’s SpeechRecognition interface to listen your voice from a microphone device in your mobile phones or PC.

2.Send your message to API.ai (the natural language processing platform) as a text string

3.Once the AI from the API.ai returns the reply text back, use the SpeechSynthesis interface to return a synthetic voice.
